# Cherax-Scripts
A compilation of my Lua scripts for use with Cherax

## [Ji9sw - Gun Van.lua](https://github.com/ji8sw/Cherax-Scripts/blob/main/Ji9sw%20-%20Gun%20Van.lua "Ji9sw - Gun Van.lua")
My most used script, and the best gun van modification script available. Originally made for Stand

## [Ji9sw - Racing Lines.lua](https://github.com/ji8sw/Cherax-Scripts/blob/main/Ji9sw%20-%20Racing%20Lines.lua "Ji9sw - Racing Lines.lua")
My second most used script, and the only other one that is published, allows you to draw and retrace lines where you've driven.

## [Ji9sw - Global Editor.lua](https://github.com/ji8sw/Cherax-Scripts/blob/main/Ji9sw%20-%20Global%20Editor.lua "Ji9sw - Global Editor.lua")
A development focused script that allows you to access internal variables (Globals & Tunables) used by GTA V's scripts

## [Ji9sw - GSB.lua](https://github.com/ji8sw/Cherax-Scripts/blob/main/Ji9sw%20-%20GSB.lua "Ji9sw - GSB.lua")
A funny script that (used to) lets you send SMS and chat messages to other users with some silly pickup lines
No longer works due to the disabling of SMS and Chat functionality within the Cherax API
